The CLEF Initiative (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) is structured in two main parts:

- a series of Evaluation Labs, i.e. laboratories to conduct evaluation of information access systems and workshops to discuss and pilot innovative evaluation activities;
- a peer-reviewed Conference on a broad range of issues, including investigation continuing the activities of the Evaluation Labs; experiments using multilingual and multimodal data; in particular, but not only, data resulting from CLEF activities; research in evaluation methodologies and challenges.

The CLEF Initiative promotes research, innovation, and development of information access systems with an emphasis on multilingual and multimodal information with various levels of structure.
