The CLEF Initiative (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) is structured in two main parts:

- a series of Evaluation Labs, i.e. laboratories to conduct evaluation of information access systems and workshops to discuss and pilot innovative evaluation activities;
- a peer-reviewed Conference on a broad range of issues, including investigation continuing the activities of the Evaluation Labs; experiments using multilingual and multimodal data; in particular, but not only, data resulting from CLEF activities; research in evaluation methodologies and challenges.

The CLEF Initiative promotes research, innovation, and development of information access systems with an emphasis on multilingual and multimodal information with various levels of structure. CLEF promotes research and development by providing an infrastructure for:

- multilingual and multimodal system testing, tuning and evaluation;
- investigation of the use of unstructured, semi-structured, highly-structured, and semantically enriched data in information access;
- creation of reusable test collections for benchmarking;
- exploration of new evaluation methodologies and innovative ways of using experimental data;
- discussion of results, comparison of approaches, exchange of ideas, and transfer of knowledge.
