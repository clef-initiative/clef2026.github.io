To help participants to get in touch with each other ahead of the conference, we provide a public Discord server.

## Public Discord server

Join our public CLEF 2026 Discord server to connect with other participants, to talk to lab organizers and chairs, or to shape the future of CLEF.

### Discord server rules

By using our Discord server, you agree to be courteous to the other server members and respect our community rules.
Most importantly, there are some no-go's:

- No members younger than 16 years.
- No [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming "For example, all-caps text, excessive punctuation, or overly irrelevant content."), [trolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang) "Disrupting a chat, making a nuisance out of yourself, deliberately making others uncomfortable, or otherwise attempting to start trouble."), [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing "For example, distributing or installing malware or computer viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware."), [doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing "Exposing personally identifiable information about an individual or organization."), or scamming.
- No [illegal](https://europol.europa.eu/report-a-crime/report-illegal-content-on-the-internet "Under EU and/or German legislation."), pirated, [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work "Content that is explicitly pornographic, depicting sexual acts, or depicting nudity."), [offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity "For example, discussions about politics, religion, acts of violence, rape, suicide, self harm, school shootings, or similar serious topics."), or otherwise unsafe content.
- No [insults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult "Including racist, sexist or homophobic statements."), harassment, threats, or [discriminatory language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination "Especially related to sex, ethnicity, race, language, origins, beliefs, age, gender, or disability.").
- No advertisements for commercial products or services.
- No cross-posting in multiple channels or mass @mentions.

The CLEF community thrives to be supportive an open. Some ideas to best use the community Discord server:

- Preferably use a clear name as the [server nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames).
- Introduce yourself and tell others about your interests and projects.
- Join the lab channels.
- Feel free to communicate in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish language.
  (If you'd volunteer to moderate, we are happy to allow additional languages.)
- Adhere to Discord's [terms of service](https://discord.com/terms), [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), and [privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy/).
- Contact @community-chairs on Discord in case of questions.
