**Title: "Beyond Relevance: Rethinking Information Access Evaluation for the AI Era"**

**Abstract:** As large language models and multimodal AI systems fundamentally transform how we seek and interact with information, our evaluation frameworks must evolve accordingly. This talk examines how traditional notions of relevance, precision, and recall are increasingly insufficient for capturing the nuanced ways humans engage with AI-mediated information access. Drawing from recent research in cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and information behavior, we will explore new evaluation paradigms that better account for context, uncertainty, and the collaborative nature of human-AI information seeking. The presentation will conclude with a roadmap for evaluation methodologies that can guide the next generation of information access systems.

**Bio:** Emma Davidson is Professor of Information Science and Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Cambridge, where she leads the Human-AI Collaboration Lab. Her research focuses on evaluation methodologies for interactive information retrieval systems, with particular emphasis on mixed-initiative interactions. Prof. Davidson has published over 120 papers in top-tier venues including SIGIR, CHI, and CIKM. She previously served as a Principal Scientist at Microsoft Research and Google DeepMind, and was the recipient of the 2024 Karen Sp√§rck Jones Award. She holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.

**Date:** Monday, September 21, 2026, 09:30-10:30  
**Location:** Auditorium Maximum, Carl-Zeiss-Building

**Title: "Multilingual Information Access in Low-Resource Settings: Bridging the Global Digital Divide"**

**Abstract:** Despite significant advances in natural language processing and information retrieval, substantial inequalities persist in how information technologies serve different language communities. This talk will present recent breakthroughs in developing robust information access systems for low-resource languages, with a particular focus on cross-lingual transfer learning, minimal supervision approaches, and community-driven data collection. Drawing from our experiences deploying multilingual information systems across 27 languages in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, I will demonstrate how thoughtful evaluation frameworks can guide the development of technologies that genuinely serve the needs of linguistically diverse communities. The presentation will conclude with an exploration of ethical considerations and collaborative research methodologies that center the expertise and priorities of language communities themselves.

**Bio:** Marco Bonetti is the Director of the Multilingual Technologies Division at the Digital Futures Institute and Adjunct Professor at the University of Bologna. His research combines computational linguistics, information retrieval, and human-centered computing to develop technologies that serve linguistically diverse communities. Before joining the Digital Futures Institute, Dr. Bonetti led the Language Technologies team at UNESCO and co-founded Polyglot Systems, an organization that develops information access tools for humanitarian contexts. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich and has published extensively on multilingual NLP and IR systems in venues including CLEF, SIGIR, ACL, and EMNLP.

**Title: "Evaluation at Scale: Lessons from a Decade of Shared Tasks in Information Access"**

**Abstract:** Shared tasks and evaluation campaigns have been instrumental in driving progress in information access research, creating standardized benchmarks and fostering healthy competition. However, as our field tackles increasingly complex, multimodal, and interactive challenges, the design of effective evaluation frameworks becomes correspondingly intricate. This talk offers a critical analysis of evaluation methodologies across major benchmark initiatives over the past decade, including TREC, CLEF, NTCIR, and industrial research platforms. Drawing on statistical analyses of 200+ shared tasks involving 15,000+ system submissions, we'll identify patterns that characterize successful evaluation frameworks, common pitfalls that limit their impact, and strategies for designing more robust and informative benchmarks. The presentation will conclude with recommendations for the future of collaborative evaluation in an era of rapidly evolving AI capabilities and research methodologies.

**Bio:** Sophia Zhang is Professor of Information Retrieval at Tsinghua University and Scientific Director of the Global Benchmarking Consortium. Her research focuses on evaluation methodologies, metrics development, and dataset creation for information access systems. Prof. Zhang has organized numerous shared tasks at CLEF, TREC, and FIRE, and developed innovative evaluation frameworks for conversational search, multimodal retrieval, and fair ranking systems. She previously served as a Distinguished Scientist at Baidu Research and Chair of the ACM SIGIR. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Washington and has published over 150 papers in top IR and NLP venues.

**Date:** Wednesday, September 23, 2026, 09:30-10:30

**Title: "Responsible Evaluation of AI-driven Information Systems: From Lab to Production"**

**Abstract:** As AI-powered information systems increasingly shape how people access knowledge, make decisions, and form beliefs, the gap between academic evaluation frameworks and real-world deployment contexts continues to widen. This talk bridges theory and practice by examining how evaluation methodologies evolve when moving from research prototypes to production systems serving millions of users. Drawing from case studies across search engines, recommendation systems, and content moderation platforms, we'll explore how responsible evaluation must account for distributional shifts, emergent behaviors, and societal impacts that often remain invisible in controlled experimental settings. The presentation will introduce practical techniques for continuous evaluation, responsible measurement, and stakeholder-informed metrics development that can help align academic research with industry practice while centering human welfare.

**Bio:** Julian Meyer is Chief Scientist at SearchTech and Visiting Professor at Technical University of Munich. His work focuses on responsible AI for information access systems, with particular emphasis on evaluation methodologies that account for real-world impacts. Before joining SearchTech, Dr. Meyer led the Responsible AI team at WikiMedia Foundation and served as Principal Researcher at IBM Watson. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University and has published extensively on evaluation methodologies for information systems at venues including SIGIR, The Web Conference, FAccT, and CIKM. Dr. Meyer also serves on the ACM SIGIR Ethics Committee and the Partnership on AI's ABOUT ML initiative.
