## About Jena

Jena is a vibrant university city in the state of Thuringia with a population of approximately 110,000.

The city has a rich industrial heritage, particularly in precision optics with companies like Carl Zeiss, Schott, and Jenoptik. Today, Jena's economy thrives on high-technology infrastructure, precision optical instruments, software engineering, digital businesses, and biotechnology.

Jena lies in a scenic hilly landscape in the wide valley of the Saale river. The city is renowned in Germany for its diverse wild orchids and offers hiking trails within walking distance of the town center.
