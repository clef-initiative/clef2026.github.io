## Overview

Over the last few years, the SimpleText Track has created an active community of researchers in NLP and IR working together to improve access to scientific text. Its benchmarks on scientific passage retrieval, scientific terminology detection and explanation, and scientific text simplification have become standard references. After using a similar track setup in 2021-2024, we significantly changed the track’s setup and tasks in 2025. We will continue this successful setup in 2026. Hence, the CLEF 2026 SimpleText track will contain the following 2+1 tasks. Task 1 (Text Simplification): Simplify scientific text. Task 2 (Controlled Creativity): Identify and avoid hallucination. Task 3 (SimpleText Revisited): selected tasks by popular request.
