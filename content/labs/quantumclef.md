## Overview

The goal of QuantumCLEF is to establish an evaluation infrastructure for quantum computing (QC) algorithms with a focus on applications in the Information Access domain. This initiative aims to: (1) explore novel problem formulations that enable the efficient and effective use of QC techniques; (2) assess the performance of QC methods in comparison to conventional, non-quantum approaches executed on classical hardware; (3) foster interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers from areas such as Information Retrieval, Recommender Systems, and Operations Research, to facilitate knowledge exchange and engagement with QC technologies.
