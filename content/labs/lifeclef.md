## Overview

Biodiversity monitoring using AI-powered tools has become vital for tracking species distributions and assessing ecosystem health on a large scale. Automated image- and sound-based species recognition, in particular, continues to accelerate conservation efforts by enabling rapid, low-cost surveys of vulnerable populations. However, the ever-growing variety of algorithms and data sources underscores the need for standardized benchmarks to assess real-world performance. Since 2011, the LifeCLEF lab has filled this role by organizing annual evaluations that promote collaboration among AI experts, citizen science, and ecologists. (i) AnimalCLEF: Discovery of individual animal, (ii) BirdCLEF+: Multi-taxonomic species identification in soundscape recordings, (iii) MarineCLEF: Location-aware classification of marine species in underwater imagery, (iv) PestCLEF: Information extraction on plant pests from news articles, (v) PlantCLEF: Multi-species plant identification in quadrat images.
