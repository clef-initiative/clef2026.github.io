The main objective of the lab is to advance the development of innovative technologies combating disinformation and manipulation efforts in online communication across a multitude of languages and platforms. The 9th edition of the CheckThat! lab at CLEF targets three tasks: (i) source retrieval for scientific web claims, (ii) fact-checking numerical claims, and (iii) generating full fact-checking articles.

## Tasks

The CheckThat! Lab features three different tasks:

{{< accordion >}}
  {{< accordion-item title="Source Retrieval for Scientific Web Claims" >}}
  Given a social media post that contains a scientific claim and an implicit reference to a scientific paper (mentions it without a URL), retrieve the mentioned paper from a pool of candidate papers.
  {{< /accordion-item >}}
  {{< accordion-item title="Fact-Checking Numerical Claims" >}}
  This task involves verifying naturally occurring claims containing numerical quantities and temporal expressions by improving the reasoning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) through test-time scaling.
  {{< /accordion-item >}}
  {{< accordion-item title="Generating Full Fact-Checking Articles" >}}
  Given a claim, its veracity, and a set of evidence documents consulted for fact-checking the claim, generate a full fact-checking article.
