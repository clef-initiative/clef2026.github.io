## Overview

The **CheckThat!** lab focuses on developing technologies for identifying and verifying claims in political debates, speeches, and social media content.

The lab aims to foster the development of technologies capable of both spotting claims in political debates or speeches and determining their veracity. These technologies would enable the automatic identification of claims made by public figures and their subsequent verification using available sources.

The lab addresses a key challenge in today's information landscape: the rapid spread of misinformation and the difficulty of manually fact-checking the huge volume of content generated daily on social media platforms, news outlets, and political discourse.

## Organizers

- Dr. Sofia Martinez, Universidad de Barcelona, Spain
- Prof. Ahmed Ibrahim, Qatar Computing Research Institute, Qatar
- Dr. Lucas Brown, University of Sheffield, UK

## Tasks

### Task 1: Check-Worthiness Estimation

Given a debate or speech, identify which claims are worth fact-checking.

### Task 2: Evidence Retrieval

For a given claim, retrieve relevant documents to support fact-checking.

### Task 3: Claim Verification

Determine whether a claim is true, false, or partially true based on retrieved evidence.
