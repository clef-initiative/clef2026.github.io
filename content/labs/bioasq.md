## Overview

BioASQ organizes a series of challenges (shared tasks) for biomedical information access and machine learning systems in two complementary research directions: (a) the automated indexing of large volumes of unlabelled data, such as scientific articles, with biomedical concepts, (b) the processing of biomedical questions and the generation of comprehensible answers. Regarding the first direction, this year BioASQ introduces i) the new Task BioNNE-R, Nested Relation Extraction in Russian and English, ii) a new edition of Task ELCardioCC on Clinical Coding of Greek Cardiology Discharge Letters written in Greek, that focuses on document-level annotation, and iii) a new edition of Task GutBrainIE on Gut-Brain Interplay Information Extraction, incorporating more diverse and relevant biomedical literature. Regarding biomedical Question Answering (QA) direction, a whole infrastructure has been developed to support the established QA task (Task B), as well as the innovative Task Synergy, on QA for developing problems. In addition, a new edition of Task MultiClinSum on multilingual summarization of clinical case reports is introduced this year (Task MultiClinSum-2), extended to additional languages, namely German, Dutch, Catalan, Swedish, Norwegian, and Italian.
