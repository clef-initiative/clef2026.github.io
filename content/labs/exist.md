This lab focuses on the detection of sexist messages in social networks (SN), particularly in complex multimedia formats such as memes and short videos. Inequality and discrimination against women that remains embedded in society is increasingly being replicated online. In this edition, we extend the Learning with Disagreement (LwD) framework by incorporating sensor-based data from people exposed to potentially sexist content. This includes measurements such as heart rate variability, EEG, eye-tracking, and other sensor data.
