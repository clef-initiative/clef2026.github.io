We propose eRisk 2026, the next edition of CLEF’s lab series on early risk prediction in online data. Building on nine previous editions (2017–2025), that explored important tasks such as depression, anorexia, self-harm, pathological gambling or eating disorders. This edition, eRisk 2026, introduces three main challenges: The first task is related with the interaction with conversational agents who have been instructed to simulate different user behaviours and conditions. Participants need to interact with the LLMs, predict the depression severity and their main symptoms (if exists). The second task corresponds to the second edition of the Contextualised Early-Depression Detection task, leveraging full Reddit conversation threads for richer conversational and contextual scenarios to emit timely risk predictions. Finally, the third task, symptom sentence ranking for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), extends our ranking framework to a previously unexplored condition. For considering the ADHD symptoms, we use the ASRS-v1.1 clinical questionnaire. The lab continues the established three-year task cycle, offers baselines and high-quality datasets, and advances conversational and symptom level analysis as key elements for mental health solutions.
