## Overview

The inaugural edition of FinMMEval, a CLEF 2026 Workshop dedicated to the multilingual and multimodal evaluation of financial AI systems. Real-world financial decision-making relies on diverse data sources, including textual reports, visual documents, and time-series signals, spread across languages and modalities. To support robust, interpretable, and auditable AI in this domain, FinMMEval proposes three complementary pilot tasks: (1) Document Parsing and Structured Extraction from scanned financial filings, (2) Financial Exam Question Answering, and (3) Financial Decision Making based on market context, combining historical prices, news, and portfolio status. The lab includes datasets in six languages, such as English, Spanish, Arabic, Greek, Bulgarian and Hindi, covering low-level perception to high-level decision-making. We aim to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration across NLP, CV, time-series modeling, and financial industries, and establish FinMMEval as a benchmark for the next generation of financial AI systems.
