The FinMMEval Lab features three different tasks:

{{< accordion  open_all="true" >}}
  {{< accordion-item title="Financial Exam Question Answering" >}}
  Evaluates models’ conceptual understanding and domain reasoning using multilingual, professional exam-style financial questions (e.g., CFA, CPA, EFPA, BBF). Performance is measured by accuracy.
  {{< /accordion-item >}}
  {{< accordion-item title="Multilingual Financial Question Answering" >}}
  Tests analytical financial reasoning using multilingual and multimodal information sources (e.g., SEC filings + cross-lingual news). Models generate concise, evidence-grounded answers evaluated with ROUGE and factuality metrics.
  {{< /accordion-item >}}
  {{< accordion-item title="Financial Decision Making" >}}
  Assesses reasoning-to-action capabilities by generating Buy/Hold/Sell trading decisions and short rationales based on textual and numerical market contexts (BTC, TSLA). Evaluated via profitability, stability, and risk metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Return).
