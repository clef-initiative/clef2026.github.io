## Overview

Building on the success of previous editions from 2003 to 2025, ImageCLEF 2026 continues as part of the CLEF initiative's Multimodal Challenge. The campaign focuses on advancing and benchmarking technologies for multimodal data analysis—including annotation, classification, indexing, and retrieval. The primary goal of ImageCLEF 2026 is to facilitate research through access to large-scale, diverse multimodal datasets tailored to a wide range of practical domains and scenarios. Continuing the momentum of recent successful editions, this year’s challenge will again embrace interdisciplinary problem solving across key areas such as medical imaging, knowledge representation, data generation, encouraging innovative, real-world solutions.
While ImageCLEF 2026 will retain the tasks from the 2025 edition, with some improvements, while adding a new task to expand futher. Participants will be invited to tackle new and evolving tasks that reflect emerging needs and technologies, fostering collaboration across disciplines.
