At its 26th edition, the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) is a continuation of the very successful series of evaluation campaigns established in 2000. CLEF uniquely combines evaluation laboratories and workshops with research presentations, panels, posters, and demo sessions. In 2026, CLEF will take place on September 21-24 at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universit√§t Jena, Germany.

Researchers and practitioners from all areas of information access and related communities are invited to submit proposals for running evaluation labs as part of CLEF 2026.

## Important Dates

{{< dates key="labs" >}}

## Lab Types

We invite submissions of proposals for two types of labs:

1. **"Campaign-style" Evaluation Labs** for specific information access problems, similar in nature to the traditional CLEF campaign "tracks". Topics can be inspired by any information access-related domain or task.

2. **Workshop-style Labs** exploring evaluation methodology, metrics, processes, etc. in information access and closely related fields such as natural language processing, machine translation, and human-computer interaction.

We highly recommend organizers new to the CLEF format to first consider organizing a workshop-style lab to discuss the format of their proposed task, the problem space, and practicalities of the shared task.

## Proposal Requirements

Lab proposals must provide sufficient information to judge the relevance, timeliness, scientific quality, benefits for the research community, and the competence of the proposers to coordinate the lab. Each proposal should identify one or more organizers as responsible for ensuring the timely execution of the lab.

Proposals should be 3-4 pages long and should provide the following information:

1. **Title** of the proposed lab

2. **Brief description** of the lab topic and goals, its relevance to CLEF, and significance for the field

3. **Usage scenarios and domain** to which the activity is intended to contribute, including the evaluation setup and metrics

4. **Details on the lab organizer(s)**, including identifying the task chair(s) and previous involvement in organizing or participating in evaluation tasks

5. **Planned format of the lab**: campaign-style ("track") or workshop

6. **Continuity information**:
  - For activities continued from previous year(s): Statistics from previous years, justification for another edition, proposed changes, and lessons learned
  - For new activities: Justification for why a new evaluation campaign is needed and community benefits

7. **Target audience** and outreach plans

8. **Tasks to be carried out** in the lab, with clear motivation for each proposed task and evidence of capability to attract participation

9. **Expected length of the lab session** at the conference: half-day, one day, or two days, with high-level details of planned structure

10. **Arrangements for organization**: responsibilities, data acquisition and creation, tools or methods to be used, and other relevant information

11. **Steering committee** information (if applicable)

## Mentorship Program for Newcomers

CLEF offers a mentorship program to support the preparation of lab proposals for newcomers to CLEF. The program offers help, guidance, and feedback on draft lab proposals by assigning mentors who assist in preparing and maturing proposals for submission.

If your proposal falls within the scope of an existing CLEF lab, the mentor will help connect you with those lab organizers to potentially combine efforts.

To request mentorship, please submit your draft proposal through the submission system by the mentorship request deadline.

## Lab Selection Process

Proposals will be reviewed by the CLEF 2026 Lab Selection Committee, composed of researchers with extensive experience in evaluating information retrieval and extraction systems. Selected proposals may be subject to suggested modifications to better align with the CLEF lab workflow or timeline.

## Advertising Labs

Organizers of accepted labs are expected to advertise their labs at both CLEF 2025 (Madrid, Spain) and ECIR 2026. At least one lab representative should attend these events to:

- Display a poster describing the new lab
- Run a break-out session to discuss with prospective participants
- Announce the lab during the closing session

## Submission

Lab proposals must be submitted using the EasyChair system:


## Lab Chairs

- Dr. Robert Anderson, University of Manchester, UK
- Dr. Mei Zhang, Tsinghua University, China
