CLEF 2026 features two kinds of submissions:
- **Conference Papers**, peer-reviewed articles published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
- **Labs Working Notes**, peer-reviewed reports describing the experiments carried out during the CLEF evaluation campaigns, published in digital form in the CEUR-WS Proceedings.

CLEF 2026 uses EasyChair for all submission types. 

## Conference Paper Submissions

Authors are invited to electronically submit original papers, which have not been published and are not under consideration elsewhere. Two categories of papers will be accepted:

- Long papers: 12 pages plus references
- Short papers: 6 pages plus references

Papers should be anonymous, sharing code and data with reviewers should be done via anonymous repositories like, for example, https://anonymous.4open.science/.

Papers are to be submitted in **Springer LNCS format**. Author information, formatting instructions, and templates can be found in Springers' official author instructions. The License-to-Publish form will be distributed together with acceptance notifications.

## Labs Working Notes & Task Overview Papers

For each task at CLEF 2026, participants must submit working notes describing their systems and organizers must submit an overview describing their task, the data used, the teams that participated and their approaches, the results obtained and the analysis of those results. The organizers of each task are responsible for collecting the working notes from their participants. 

Both working notes and task overviews are to be submitted in **1-column CEURART format**. Submissions are expected to be in English language and 5 pages minimum, with no maximum page limit.
