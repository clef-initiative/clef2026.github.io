## Aim and Scope

The CLEF 2026 Conference welcomes papers in the Information Access domain that describe rigorous hypothesis testing regardless of whether the results are positive or negative. Each submission is reviewed in two stages using our result-less review process.

CLEF 2026 is the 26th CLEF conference continuing the popular CLEF campaigns which have run since 2000, contributing to the systematic evaluation of information access systems, primarily through experimentation on shared tasks.

The CLEF conference has a clear focus on experimental Information Retrieval (IR) with special attention to the challenges of multimodality, multilinguality, and interactive search in different domains, considering specific classes of users.

## Topics of Interest

We invite submissions on significant new insights demonstrated on IR test collections, analysis of IR test collections and evaluation measures, as well as concrete proposals to push the boundaries of the Cranfield style evaluation paradigm.

Topics include but are not limited to:

1. **Information access in any language or modality**: information retrieval, image retrieval, question answering, search interfaces and design, infrastructures, etc.

2. **Analytics for information retrieval**: theoretical and practical results in the analytics field specifically targeted for information access data analysis, data enrichment, etc.

3. **Reproducibility and replicability issues**: analyses of past results, statistical analysis, and fine-grained system behavior.

4. **Language diversity**: work on low-resource languages.

5. **Models leveraging collaborative and social data** and their evaluation.

6. **User studies** based on lab studies or crowdsourcing.

7. **Evaluation initiatives**: conclusions, lessons learned, impact and projection of evaluation initiatives.

8. **Evaluation methodologies**: metrics, statistical tools, component-based evaluation, ground-truth creation, impact of multilingual/multicultural/multimodal differences, etc.

9. **Technology transfer**: economic impact of information access approaches, deployment and exploitation of systems, use cases, etc.

10. **Interactive and Conversational Information Retrieval evaluation**: user-centered methods, novel search interfaces, simulation of interaction, etc.

11. **Specific application domains**: information access in cultural heritage, digital libraries, social media, health information, legal documents, patents, news, books, in text, audio and/or image data.

12. **New data collections**: presentation of new collections with potential high impact on future research.

## Result-Less Review Process

Papers will be peer-reviewed by 3 members of the programme committee in two stages:

1. **Methodology version (restricted)**: This version does NOT report anything related to the results of the study. It is evaluated based on the importance of the problem addressed and the soundness of the methodology. This version should include:
  - Introduction
  - Proposed methodology
  - Datasets used

   It should NOT include results or discussion sections, and no mentions of results in the included sections.

2. **Experimental version (complete)**: The complete manuscript containing all sections of the paper including experiments and results.

Both versions must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline.

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to electronically submit original papers, which have not been published and are not under consideration elsewhere, using the LNCS proceedings format.

Two categories of papers will be accepted:

1. **Long papers**: 12 pages plus references
2. **Short papers**: 6 pages plus references

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
Papers should be anonymous. If sharing code and data with reviewers, please use anonymous repositories like [https://anonymous.4open.science/](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

## Publication

The conference proceedings will be published in the **Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)** series.
